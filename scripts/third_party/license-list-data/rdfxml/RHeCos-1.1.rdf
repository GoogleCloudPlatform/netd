&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 3.1.&lt;/var&gt;
          Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
             governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source
             Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a
             future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this
             License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any
             terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
             License or the recipients&amp;apos; rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
             offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 3.2.&lt;/var&gt;
          Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
             made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License via an accepted Electronic
             Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available and to the
             Initial Developer; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain
             available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at
             least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made
             available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
             remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third
             party. You are responsible for notifying the Initial Developer of the Modification and the
             location of the Source if a contact means is provided. Red Hat will be acting as maintainer of
             the Source and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be
             made available. You can contact Red Hat to make the Modification available and to notify the
             Initial Developer. (http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ecos/)
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 3.3.&lt;/var&gt;
          Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain
             a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any
             change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
             indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
             Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or
             related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;

          Intellectual Property Matters
          
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; (a)&lt;/var&gt;
              Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in
                 particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a
                 text file with the source code distribution titled &amp;quot;LEGAL&amp;quot; which describes the claim and the
                 party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you
                 obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2,
                 You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall
                 take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably
                 calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been
                 obtained.
            &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; (b)&lt;/var&gt;
              Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or
                 control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include
                 this information in the LEGAL file.
            &lt;/li&gt;
                  
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 3.5.&lt;/var&gt;
          Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and
             this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients&amp;apos; rights
             relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as
             a Contributor to the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular
             Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such
             as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may
             choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
             obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.
          &lt;p&gt;However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
             Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
             liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
             Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
             Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 3.6.&lt;/var&gt;
          Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if
             the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a
             notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms
             of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations
             of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
             version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&amp;apos; rights relating
             to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license
             of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
             compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does
             not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&amp;apos;s rights in the Source Code version from the
             rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
             license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are
             offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to
             indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
             Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
          &lt;p&gt;If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in
             Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 3.7.&lt;/var&gt;
          Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed
             by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a
             case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
             Code.
        &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
      INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION
      &lt;p&gt;If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some
         or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the
         terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; (b) cite the statute or regulation that
         prohibits you from adhering to the license; and (c) describe the limitations and the code they
         affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
         be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by
         statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
         ordinary skill to be able to understand it. You must submit this LEGAL file to Red Hat for
         review, and You will not be able use the covered code in any means until permission is granted
         from Red Hat to allow for the inability to comply due to statute or regulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
      APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE
      &lt;p&gt;This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A,
         and to related Covered Code.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Red Hat may include Covered Code in products without such additional products becoming subject to
         the terms of this License, and may license such additional products on different terms from
         those contained in this License.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Red Hat may license the Source Code of Red Hat Branded Code without Red Hat Branded Code becoming
         subject to the terms of this License, and may license Red Hat Branded Code on different terms
         from those contained in this License. Contact Red Hat for details of alternate licensing terms
         available.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
      VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE
      
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 6.1.&lt;/var&gt;
          New Versions. Red Hat may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time.
             Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 6.2.&lt;/var&gt;
          Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
             License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also
             choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
             published by Red Hat. No one other than Red Hat has the right to modify the terms applicable
             to Covered Code beyond what is granted under this and subsequent Licenses.
        &lt;/li&gt;

                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 6.3.&lt;/var&gt;
          Derivative Works. If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do
             in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you
             must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases &amp;quot;ECOS&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;eCos&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Red Hat&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;RHEPL&amp;quot; or any
             confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it
             clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Red Hat eCos
             Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in
             the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
             this License.)
        &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
         &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
      DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
      &lt;p&gt;COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
         EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE
         IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE
         RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED
         CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR)
         ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
         CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED
         HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
      TERMINATION
      &lt;p&gt;This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply
         with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
         All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination
         of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
         termination of this License shall survive.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;
      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
      &lt;p&gt;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT,
         OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
         COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR
         ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,
         WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
         MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE
         BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY
         TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&amp;apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
         APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
         LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
         APPLY TO YOU.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;
      U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS
      &lt;p&gt;The Covered Code is a &amp;quot;commercial item,&amp;quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995),
         consisting of &amp;quot;commercial computer software&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;commercial computer software documentation,&amp;quot;
         as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and
         48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire
         Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 11.&lt;/var&gt;
      MISCELLANEOUS
      &lt;p&gt;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision
         of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
         extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law
         provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its
         conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen
         of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in, the United States of America: (a)
         unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating to this License (excepting any
         dispute relating to intellectual property rights) shall be subject to final and binding
         arbitration, with the losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration
         relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara County, California, under the auspices
         of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the
         jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in
         Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without
         limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the
         United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
         excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
         construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 12.&lt;/var&gt;
      RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS
      &lt;p&gt;Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with Section 3.4, You are
         responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights
         under this License, based on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the
         revenues you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You agree to
         work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an equitable basis.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;/li&gt;
         
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 13.&lt;/var&gt;
      ADDITIONAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO THE RED HAT ECOS PUBLIC LICENSE

  &lt;p&gt;Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Red Hat from licensing under different terms
     than this License any code which Red Hat otherwise would have a right to license.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Red Hat and logo - This License does not grant any rights to use the trademark Red Hat, the Red Hat logo,
     eCos logo, even if such marks are included in the Original Code. You may contact Red Hat for
     permission to display the Red Hat and eCos marks in either the documentation or the Executable version
     beyond that required in Exhibit B.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Inability to Comply Due to Contractual Obligation - To the extent that Red Hat is limited contractually
     from making third party code available under this License, Red Hat may choose to integrate such third
     party code into Covered Code without being required to distribute such third party code in Source Code
     form, even if such third party code would otherwise be considered &amp;quot;Modifications&amp;quot; under this
     License.&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;/ul&gt;

          (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Initial Developer, to make, have made, use and sell ("Utilize") the Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.

          (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code or as part of a Larger Work; and

          (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by Contributor, to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or combinations.

3. DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS

     3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

     3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available and to the Initial Developer; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You are responsible for notifying the Initial Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source if a contact means is provided. Red Hat will be acting as maintainer of the Source and may provide an Electronic Distribution mechanism for the Modification to be made available. You can contact Red Hat to make the Modification available and to notify the Initial Developer. (http://sourceware.cygnus.com/ecos/)

     3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

          (a) Third Party Claims.  If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

          (b) Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

     3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.

     However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

     If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.

     3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; (b) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits you from adhering to the license; and (c) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. You must submit this LEGAL file to Red Hat for review, and You will not be able use the covered code in any means until permission is granted from Red Hat to allow for the inability to comply due to statute or regulation.

5. APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE

This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

Red Hat may include Covered Code in products without such additional products becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license such additional products on different terms from those contained in this License.

Red Hat may license the Source Code of Red Hat Branded Code without Red Hat Branded Code becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license Red Hat Branded Code on different terms from those contained in this License. Contact Red Hat for details of alternate licensing terms available.

6. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE

     6.1. New Versions. Red Hat may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

     6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Red Hat. No one other than Red Hat has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code beyond what is granted under this and subsequent Licenses.

     6.3. Derivative Works.

The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available and to the Initial Developer; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party. You are responsible for notifying the Initial Developer of the Modification and the location of the Source if a contact means is provided.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Intellectual Property Matters

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Third Party Claims. If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification available as described in Section 3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Contributor APIs. If Your Modification is an application programming interface and You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a Contributor to the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.

      However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

      If you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.7.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; (b) cite the statute or regulation that prohibits you from adhering to the license; and (c) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. You must submit this LEGAL file to Red Hat for review, and You will not be able use the covered code in any means until permission is granted from Red Hat to allow for the inability to comply due to statute or regulation.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

   Red Hat may include Covered Code in products without such additional products becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license such additional products on different terms from those contained in this License.

   Red Hat may license the Source Code of Red Hat Branded Code without Red Hat Branded Code becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may license Red Hat Branded Code on different terms from those contained in this License.
