Modifications: Version: 2.1.8.7-current Copyright 1998-2001 by Rob Braun

Sensor Addition Version: 2.1.8.9pre14a Copyright 2001 by Steve Grubb

This is an exerpt from an email I recieved from the original author, allowing xinetd as maintained by me (Rob Braun), to use the higher version numbers:

I appreciate your maintaining the version string guidelines as specified in the copyright. But I did not mean them to last as long as they did.

So, if you want, you may use any 2.N.* (N &gt;= 3) version string for future xinetd versions that you release. Note that I am excluding the 2.2.* line; using that would only create confusion. Naming the next release 2.3.0 would put to rest the confusion about 2.2.1 and 2.1.8.*.
