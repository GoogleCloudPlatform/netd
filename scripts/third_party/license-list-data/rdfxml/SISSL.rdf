   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.0";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Application of License. The Source Code version of Original Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. Your license for shipment of the Contributor Version is conditioned upon Your full compliance with this Section. The Modifications which You create must comply with all requirements set out by the Standards body in effect one hundred twenty (120) days before You ship the Contributor Version. In the event that the Modifications do not meet such requirements, You agree to publish either (i) any deviation from the Standards protocol resulting from implementation of Your Modifications and a reference implementation of Your Modifications or (ii) Your Modifications in Source Code form, and to make any such deviation and reference implementation or Modifications available to all third parties under the same terms as this license on a royalty free basis within thirty (30) days of Your first customer shipment of Your Modifications.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add Your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Initial Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Your version of the Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Original Code in Executable and Source form only if the requirements of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 have been met for that Original Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Original Code is available under the terms of this License. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable or Source versions, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Original Code. You may distribute the Executable and Source versions of Your version of the Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License. If You distribute the Executable and Source versions under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer as a result of any such terms You offer.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.4";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Original Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Original Code.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.0";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Original Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.2 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.0";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE

   This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Modifications as set out in Section 3.1.

THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY ORIGINAL CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.0";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; TERMINATION

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Original Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; In the event of termination under Section 8.1 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.0";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; LIMIT OF LIABILITY

   UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF ORIGINAL CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

You may distribute the Executable and Source versions of Your version of the Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License. If You distribute the Executable and Source versions under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer as a result of any such terms You offer.

4.0 INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Original Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.2 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

                 shipment of the Contributor Version is conditioned upon Your full compliance with this
                 Section. The Modifications which You create must comply with all requirements set out by the
                 Standards body in effect one hundred twenty (120) days before You ship the Contributor

                 it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure,
                 then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user
                 would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may
                 add Your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate

                 warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Your
                 version of the Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the
                 Initial Developer. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support,
                 indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify
                 the Initial Developer for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer as a result of
                 warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

              Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Original Code in Executable and Source
                 form only if the requirements of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 have been met for that Original Code,
                 and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Original Code is
                 available under the terms of this License. The notice must be conspicuously included in any
                 notice in an Executable or Source versions, related documentation or collateral in which You
                 describe recipients&amp;apos; rights relating to the Original Code. You may distribute the Executable
                 and Source versions of Your version of the Code or ownership rights under a license of Your
                 choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
                 compliance with the terms of this License. If You distribute the Executable and Source
                 versions under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which
                 differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer. You hereby
                 agree to indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer

              Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Original Code with other code not
                 governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In
                 such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
                 Original Code.
            &lt;/li&gt;

          INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION
          &lt;p&gt;If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some
             or all of the Original Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a)
             comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
             limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file
             described in Section 3.2 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
             Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
             sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

             RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE ORIGINAL CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY ORIGINAL
             CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
             NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
             ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY ORIGINAL CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT

              This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply
                 with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
                 All sublicenses to the Original Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination
                 of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
                 termination of this License shall survive.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 8.2&lt;/var&gt;
              In the event of termination under Section 8.1 above, all end user license agreements (excluding
                 distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor
                 hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.
            &lt;/li&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT,
             OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
             ORIGINAL CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY
             INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
             LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR
             ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF
             THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR
             DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&amp;apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
             PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
             INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO
             YOU.&lt;/p&gt;

          MISCELLANEOUS
          &lt;p&gt;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
             License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
             make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent
             applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to
             disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do
             business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to
             the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in
             Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without
             limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&amp;apos; fees and expenses. The application of the United
             Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
             regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall
             not apply to this License.&lt;/p&gt;
