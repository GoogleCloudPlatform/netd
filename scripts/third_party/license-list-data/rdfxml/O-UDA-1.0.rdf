         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.1.1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You include with any Data you redistribute all credit or attribution information that you received with the Data, and your terms require any Downstream Recipient to do the same; and

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.1.2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Your terms include a warranty disclaimer and limitation of liability for Upstream Data Providers at least as broad as those contained in Section 4.2 and 4.3 of the O-UDA.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Data Provider does not represent or warrant that it has any rights whatsoever in the Data.

Results may include de minimis portions of the Data necessary to report on or explain use that has been conducted with the Data, such as figures in scientific papers, but do not include more. Artificial intelligence models trained on Data (and which do not include more than a de minimis portion of Data) are Results.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; "Upstream Data Providers" means the source or sources from which the Data Provider directly or indirectly received, under the terms of the O-UDA, material that is included in the Data.</spdx:standardLicenseTemplate>
