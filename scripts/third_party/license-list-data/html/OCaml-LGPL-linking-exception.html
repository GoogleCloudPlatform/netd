              System</var>&quot; with a publicly distributed version of <var class="replacable-license-text"> the OCaml Core
              System</var> to produce an executable file containing portions of
              <var class="replacable-license-text"> the OCaml Core
              System</var>, and distribute that executable file under terms of
              your choice, without any of the additional requirements listed in
              clause 6 of the GNU Lesser General Public License. By &quot;a publicly
              distributed version of <var class="replacable-license-text"> the OCaml Core

              OCaml Core System</var> as distributed by <var class="replacable-license-text"> INRIA</var>, or a modified version of <var class="replacable-license-text">

              conditions defined in clause 2 of the GNU Lesser General Public
              License. This exception does not however invalidate any other
              reasons why the executable file might be covered by the GNU Lesser
              General Public License.
