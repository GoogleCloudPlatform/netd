Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose on any computer system, and to redistribute it freely, subject to the following restrictions:

1. The author is not responsible for the consequences of use of this software, no matter how awful, even if they arise from defects in it.

Beware that some of this code is subtly aware of the way operator precedence is structured in regular expressions. Serious changes in regular-expression syntax might require a total rethink.
