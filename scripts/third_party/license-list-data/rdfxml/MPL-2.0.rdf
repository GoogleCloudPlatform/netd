--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *

*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *

*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *

*                                                                      *

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License
---------------------------

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
steward.

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
such modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.

      This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Subsequent Licenses

      No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Representation

      Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Fair Use

   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;-------------------

   &lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Distribution of Source Form

      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Distribution of Executable Form

      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Distribution of a Larger Work

      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Notices

      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Application of Additional Terms

      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;---------------------------------------------------

   &lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;

   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Termination

   &lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;--------------

   &lt;&lt;endOptional&gt;&gt;

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Disclaimer of Warranty

   Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.

This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

      If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).

              Effective Date
                &lt;p&gt;The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective
                     for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such
                     Contribution.
              &lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;

              Limitations on Grant Scope
                &lt;p&gt;The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License.
                     No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or
                     licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b)
                     above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:
              &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; (a)&lt;/var&gt;
                  for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or
                &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; (b)&lt;/var&gt;
                  for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party&amp;apos;s modifications of
                     Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software
                     (except as part of its Contributor Version); or
                &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; (c)&lt;/var&gt;
                  under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.
                &lt;/li&gt;
                  
&lt;/ul&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any
                 Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in
                 Section 3.4).&lt;/p&gt;

              Subsequent Licenses
                &lt;p&gt;No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the
                     Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or
                     under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section
                     3.3).&lt;/p&gt;

              Representation
                &lt;p&gt;Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its
                     original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its
                     Contributions conveyed by this License.

              Fair Use
                &lt;p&gt;This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright
                     doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.

              Conditions
                &lt;p&gt;Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;

              Distribution of Source Form
                &lt;p&gt;All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications
                     that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this
                     License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered
                     Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy
                     of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients&amp;apos;
                     rights in the Source Code Form.
              &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 3.2.&lt;/var&gt;
              Distribution of Executable Form
                &lt;p&gt;If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; (a)&lt;/var&gt;
                  such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in
                     Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain
                     a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no
                     more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
                &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; (b)&lt;/var&gt;
                  You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it
                     under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not
                     attempt to limit or alter the recipients&amp;apos; rights in the Source Code Form under
                     this License.
                &lt;/li&gt;

              Distribution of a Larger Work
                &lt;p&gt;You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that
                     You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If
                     the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one
                     or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With
                     Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such
                     Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the
                     recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
                     Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).

              Notices
                &lt;p&gt;You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright
                     notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability)
                     contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may
                     alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual
                     inaccuracies.
              &lt;/p&gt;

              Application of Additional Terms
                &lt;p&gt;You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
                     liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You
                     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must
                     make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability
                     obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every
                     Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of
                     warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include
                     additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
                     jurisdiction.
              &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to
                 some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then
                 You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible;
                 and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be
                 placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
                 this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
                 description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able
                 to understand it.
          &lt;/p&gt;

              The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with
                 any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this
                 License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until
                 such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
                 basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable
                 means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants
                 from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
                 notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You
                 have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You
                 become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 5.2.&lt;/var&gt;
              If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim
                 (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a
                 Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted
                 to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this
                 License shall terminate.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 5.3.&lt;/var&gt;
              In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements
                 (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your
                 distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.

                &lt;p&gt;Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one
                     other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of
                     this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
              &lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 10.2.&lt;/var&gt;
              Effect of New Versions
                &lt;p&gt;You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License
                     under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of
                     any subsequent version published by the license steward.
              &lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 10.3.&lt;/var&gt;
              Modified Versions
                &lt;p&gt;If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new
                     license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this
                     License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the
                     license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this
                     License).
              &lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
