We therefore hereby grant the following additional permission with respect to the use and distribution of the Software with Other FOSS, and the constants, function signatures, data structures and other invocation methods used to run or interact with each of them (as to each, such software&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;Interfaces&amp;quot;):&lt;/p&gt;

The Software&amp;apos;s Interfaces remain at all times under the Software License, including without limitation as used in the Other FOSS (which upon any such use also then contains a portion of the Software under the Software License).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; (iii)&lt;/var&gt; If only Interfaces and no other code is copied between the Software and the Other FOSS in either direction, the use and/or distribution of the Software with the Other FOSS shall not be deemed to require that the Other FOSS be licensed under the license of the Software, other than as to any Interfaces of the Software copied into the Other FOSS.  This includes, by way of example and without limitation, statically or dynamically linking the Software together with Other FOSS after enabling interoperability using the Interfaces of one or both, and distributing the resulting combination under different licenses for the respective portions thereof.&lt;/li&gt;

Nothing in this additional permission grants any right to distribute any portion of the Software on terms other than those of the Software License or grants any additional permission of any kind for use or distribution of the Software in conjunction with software other than Other FOSS.&lt;/p&gt;
