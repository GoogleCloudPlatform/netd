     (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
     (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Code (or portions thereof).
     (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes Original Code under the terms of this License.
     (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2) separate from the Original Code; or 3) for infringements caused by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.

2.2 Contributor Grant. Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license
     (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

3. Distribution Obligations.

3.1 Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.

3.2 Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

3.3 Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

3.4 Intellectual Property Matters.
     (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has actual knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter.
     (b) Contributor API's. If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has actual knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.
     (c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

3.5 Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be most likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability (excluding any liability arising from intellectual property claims relating to the Covered Code) incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligation of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability (excluding any liability arising from intellectual property claims relating to the Covered Code) incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

3.7 Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License. This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

6.1 New Versions. The Storage Networking Industry Association (the "SNIA") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

6.2 Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the SNIA. No one other than the SNIA has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

6.3 Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "Storage Networking Industry Association," "SNIA," or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the SNIA Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within a reasonable time after becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that: o (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of this License or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

14. ACCEPTANCE. This License is accepted by You if You retain, use, or distribute the Covered Code for any purpose.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.4";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Intellectual Property Matters.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Third Party Claims. If Contributor has actual knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Contributor API's. If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has actual knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="(c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.5";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be most likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability (excluding any liability arising from intellectual property claims relating to the Covered Code) incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.6";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligation of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability (excluding any liability arising from intellectual property claims relating to the Covered Code) incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.7";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Application of this License. This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Versions of the License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; New Versions. The Storage Networking Industry Association (the "SNIA") may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the SNIA. No one other than the SNIA has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases "Storage Networking Industry Association," "SNIA," or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the SNIA Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="7.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; TERMINATION.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within a reasonable time after becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that: o (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.4";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="10.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="11.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; MISCELLANEOUS This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="12.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="13.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of this License or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="14.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; ACCEPTANCE. This License is accepted by You if You retain, use, or distribute the Covered Code for any purpose.&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt; EXHIBIT A The SNIA Public License.

          the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first
             makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; (d)&lt;/var&gt;
          Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for any code that
             Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2) separate from the Contributor
             Version; 3) for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor Version
             or ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software (except
             as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by
             Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
          Distribution Obligations.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 3.1&lt;/var&gt;
          Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
             governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source
             Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a
             future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this
             License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any
             terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
             License or the recipients&amp;apos; rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document
             offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 3.2&lt;/var&gt;
          Availability of Source Code. Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
             made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as
             an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom
             you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution
             Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially
             became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular
             Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that
             the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
             maintained by a third party.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 3.3&lt;/var&gt;
          Description of Modifications. You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain
             a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any
             change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or
             indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
             Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or
             related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 3.4&lt;/var&gt;
          Intellectual Property Matters.
        &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;/ul&gt;
      
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; (a)&lt;/var&gt;
          Third Party Claims. If Contributor has actual knowledge that a license under a third party&amp;apos;s
             intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor
             under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
             distribution titled &amp;quot;LEGAL&amp;quot; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in
             sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such
             knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor
             shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; (b)&lt;/var&gt;
          Contributor API&amp;apos;s. If Contributor&amp;apos;s Modifications include an application programming interface
             and Contributor has actual knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to
             implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; (c)&lt;/var&gt;
          Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a)
             above, Contributor believes that Contributor&amp;apos;s Modifications are Contributor&amp;apos;s original
             creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
             License.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 3.5&lt;/var&gt;
          Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If
             it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure,
             then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user
             would be most likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You
             may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also
             duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients&amp;apos;
             rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a
             fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
             Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
             Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
             support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
             indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability (excluding any
             liability arising from intellectual property claims relating to the Covered Code) incurred by
             the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
             liability terms You offer.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 3.6&lt;/var&gt;
          Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if
             the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a
             notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms
             of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligation of
             Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,
             related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&amp;apos; rights relating to the
             Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights
             under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided
             that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
             Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&amp;apos;s rights in the Source
             Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable
             version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which
             differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
             Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
             liability (excluding any liability arising from intellectual property claims relating to the
             Covered Code) incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
             terms You offer.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 3.7&lt;/var&gt;
          Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed
             by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a
             case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
             Code.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
          Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. If it is impossible for You to comply with any
             of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute,
             judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
             maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such
             description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included
             with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or
             regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill
             to be able to understand it.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
          Application of this License. This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
             attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
          Versions of the License.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 6.1&lt;/var&gt;
          New Versions. The Storage Networking Industry Association (the &amp;quot;SNIA&amp;quot;) may publish revised and/or
             new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
             version number.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 6.2&lt;/var&gt;
          Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
             License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also
             choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
             published by the SNIA. No one other than the SNIA has the right to modify the terms applicable
             to Covered Code created under this License.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 6.3&lt;/var&gt;
          Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do
             in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You
             must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases &amp;quot;Storage Networking Industry Association,&amp;quot;
             &amp;quot;SNIA,&amp;quot; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that
             your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of
             the license contains terms which differ from the SNIA Public License. (Filling in the name of
             the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall
             not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
          DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS, WITHOUT
             WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
             THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
             NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH
             YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR
             ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS
             DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED
             CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
          TERMINATION.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 8.1&lt;/var&gt;
          This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply
             with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within a reasonable time after becoming aware
             of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive
             any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
             beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 8.2&lt;/var&gt;
          If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
             judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or
             Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as &amp;quot;Participant&amp;quot;) alleging that:
             o (a) such Participant&amp;apos;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
             any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
             License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within
             60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually
             agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
             Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version
             against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment
             arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is
             not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2
             automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 8.3&lt;/var&gt;
          If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant&amp;apos;s
             Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved
             (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation,
             then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or
             2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
             license.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 8.4&lt;/var&gt;
          In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements
             (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any
             distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;
          LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
             (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER
             CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
             LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
             CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
             FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY
             SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
             SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&amp;apos;S
             NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
             ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
             AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;
          U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Code is a &amp;quot;commercial item,&amp;quot; as that term is defined in 48
             C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &amp;quot;commercial computer software&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;commercial
             computer software documentation,&amp;quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
             Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
             U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 11.&lt;/var&gt;
          MISCELLANEOUS This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If
             any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed
             only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
             California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise),
             excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on
             Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
             which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall
             not apply to this License.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 12.&lt;/var&gt;
          RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
             responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of
             rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
             distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be
             deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 13.&lt;/var&gt;
          MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE. Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
             &amp;quot;Multiple-Licensed&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Multiple-Licensed&amp;quot; means that the Initial Developer permits you to
             utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of this License or the alternative
             licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 14.&lt;/var&gt;
          ACCEPTANCE. This License is accepted by You if You retain, use, or distribute the Covered Code
             for any purpose.
        &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;/ul&gt;
