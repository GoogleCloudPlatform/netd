Version 1.2

This Academic Free License applies to any original work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the
following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:

     Licensed under the Academic Free License version 1.2

Grant of License. Licensor hereby grants to any person obtaining a copy of the Original Work ("You") a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, non-sublicenseable license (1) to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, perform, distribute and/or sell copies of the Original Work and derivative works thereof, and (2) under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work and derivative works thereof, subject to the
following conditions.

Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

Exclusions from License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor.

Warranty and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work is owned by the Licensor or that the Original Work is distributed by Licensor under a valid current license from the copyright owner. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.

Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

License to Source Code. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available
documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.

Mutual Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License if You file a lawsuit in any court alleging that any OSI Certified open source software that is licensed under any license containing this "Mutual Termination for Patent Action" clause infringes any patent claims that are essential to use that software.

Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

This license is Copyright (C) 2002 Lawrence E. Rosen. All rights reserved.
Permission is hereby granted to copy and distribute this license without modification. This license may not be modified without the express written permission of its copyright owner.

    <rdfs:comment>This license has been superseded by later versions. We found these notes here: https://web.archive.org/web/20100828113909/http://opensource.linux-mirror.org/licenses/afl-1.2.txt The following is intended to describe the essential differences between the Academic Free License (AFL) version 1.0 and other open source licenses: The Academic Free License is similar to the BSD, MIT, UoI/NCSA and Apache licenses in many respects but it is intended to solve a few problems with those licenses. * The AFL is written so as to make it clear what software is being licensed (by the inclusion of a statement following the copyright notice in the software). This way, the license functions better than a template license. The BSD, MIT and UoI/NCSA licenses apply to unidentified software. * The AFL contains a complete copyright grant to the software. The BSD and Apache licenses are vague and incomplete in that respect. * The AFL contains a complete patent grant to the software. The BSD, MIT, UoI/NCSA and Apache licenses rely on an implied patent license and contain no explicit patent grant. * The AFL makes it clear that no trademark rights are granted to the licensor's trademarks. The Apache license contains such a provision, but the BSD, MIT and UoI/NCSA licenses do not. * The AFL includes the warranty by the licensor that it either owns the copyright or that it is distributing the software under a license. None of the other licenses contain that warranty. All other warranties are disclaimed, as is the case for the other licenses. * The AFL is itself copyrighted (with the right granted to copy and distribute without modification). This ensures that the owner of the copyright to the license will control changes. The Apache license contains a copyright notice, but the BSD, MIT and UoI/NCSA licenses do not.</rdfs:comment>

         &lt;p&gt;Licensed under the Academic Free License version 1.2&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Grant of License. Licensor hereby grants to any person obtaining a copy of the Original Work (&amp;quot;You&amp;quot;) a
         world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, non-sublicenseable license (1) to use, copy,

         the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original
         Work and derivative works thereof, subject to the following conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all
         copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any
         notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an &amp;quot;Attribution Notice.&amp;quot; You must
         cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice
         reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Exclusions from License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the
         Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote
         products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Warranty and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work is
         owned by the Licensor or that the Original Work is distributed by Licensor under a valid current
         license from the copyright owner. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence,
         the Original Work is provided under this License on an &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either
         express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY
         or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH
         YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to Original
         Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
         negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct,
         indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
         License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses.
         This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
         Licensor&amp;apos;s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do
         not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and
         limitation may not apply to You.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;License to Source Code. The term &amp;quot;Source Code&amp;quot; means the preferred form of the Original Work for making
         modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor
         hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each
         copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this
         obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository

         Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that
         information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to
         the Original Work.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Mutual Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer
         exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License if You file a lawsuit in any court alleging
         that any OSI Certified open source software that is licensed under any license containing this &amp;quot;Mutual
         Termination for Patent Action&amp;quot; clause infringes any patent claims that are essential to use that
         software.&lt;/p&gt;
