         services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
         of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of &amp;quot;derived work&amp;quot;.

      &lt;p&gt;Also note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as the kernel
      is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not
