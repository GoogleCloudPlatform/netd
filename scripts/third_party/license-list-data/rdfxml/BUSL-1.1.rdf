      &lt;p&gt;
        Effective on the Change Date, or the fourth anniversary of the first publicly
        available distribution of a specific version of the Licensed Work under this
        License, whichever comes first, the Licensor hereby grants you rights under

        If your use of the Licensed Work does not comply with the requirements
        currently in effect as described in this License, you must purchase a
        commercial license from the Licensor, its affiliated entities, or authorized
        resellers, or you must refrain from using the Licensed Work.

    <rdfs:comment>The Business Source License (this document, or the “License”) is not an Open Source license. However, the Licensed Work will eventually be made available under an Open Source License, as stated in this License. This is a paramaterized license. The license parameters are: restrictions on usage, a change date, and the open source license that will govern usage of the software after the change date.</rdfs:comment>
