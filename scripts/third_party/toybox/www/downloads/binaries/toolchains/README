These toolchains were built with musl-cross-make.tar.xz, which includes
all the source tarballs. Run ./mcm-buildall.sh to reproduce them in the
"ccc" subdirectory. See https://landley.net/toybox/faq.html#cross2
for details.

The native-compiler.sqf files are loopback mountable squashfs filesystems.

Currently built from: musl 1.2.3, linux 5.17, gcc 9.4.0, binutils 2.33.1
