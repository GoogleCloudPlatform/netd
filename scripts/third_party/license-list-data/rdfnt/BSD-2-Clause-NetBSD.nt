<http://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause-NetBSD> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment> "NetBSD adopted this 2-clause license in 2008 for code contributed to NetBSD Foundation. It is being deprecated as a separate license because it is a match to BSD-2-Clause. The line describing that the code is derived from software contributed to NetBSD is not viewed as being a substantive part of the license text." .
