      &lt;p&gt;We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, we do ask that credit is given to us for

         of your programs (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that you acknowledge this fact
         somewhere in the documentation, research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have developed a nice
         tool with the output, please mention that you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the
         headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these guidelines are kept, we expect to continue
         enhancing this system and expect to make other tools available as they are completed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <rdfs:comment>ANTLR used a public domain notice through version 2.7 and then switched to a BSD license for version 3.0 and later. Their original notice did not include the third paragraph with the fallback license listed here; see ANTLR-PD for the version without this third paragraph.</rdfs:comment>
