&lt;li&gt;
	      &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 2.2.&lt;/var&gt;
	      Patent Licensing Commitment.

	      included in that Draft Specification, and
	      2) Implementations of the Approved Specification.
	      This patent licensing commitment does not apply to those claims

	      As a Result of Contributions.
	      Contributor may exclude Necessary Claims
	      from its licensing commitments incurred under Section 2.1.1
	      by issuing an Exclusion Notice within 45 days of the date of that Contribution.

&lt;li&gt;
	      &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 3.2.&lt;/var&gt;
	      As a Result of a Draft Specification Becoming an Approved Specification.
	      Prior to the adoption of a Draft Specification as an Approved Specification,
	      Contributor may exclude Necessary Claims
	      from its licensing commitments under this Agreement
	      by issuing an Exclusion Notice.
	      Contributor may not issue an Exclusion Notice for patents
	      that were eligible to have been excluded pursuant to Section 3.1.

	&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
	  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
	  Antitrust Compliance.
	  Contributor acknowledge that it may compete with other participants in various lines of business
	  and that it is therefore imperative that they and their respective representatives act
	  in a manner that does not violate any applicable antitrust laws and regulations.
	  This License does not restrict any Contributor from engaging
	  in similar specification development projects.
	  Each Contributor may design, develop, manufacture, acquire or market
	  competitive deliverables, products, and services, and conduct its business,
	  in whatever way it chooses.
	  No Contributor is obligated to announce or market any products or services.
	  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Contributors
	  agree not to have any discussion relating to any product pricing,
	  methods or channels of product distribution, division of markets,
	  allocation of customers or any other topic that should not be discussed
	  among competitors under the auspices of the Working Group.

&lt;li&gt;
	  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
	  Non-Circumvention.
	  Contributor agrees that it will not intentionally take or willfully assist any third party
	  to take any action for the purpose of circumventing any obligations under this License.
	&lt;/li&gt;

	  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
	    
&lt;li&gt;
	      &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 8.1.&lt;/var&gt;

	      1) it is legally entitled to grant the rights set forth in this License and

	      OR TITLE, RELATED TO THE CONTRIBUTION OR THE SPECIFICATION.

	      WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE,
	      AND WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.
	      Any obligations regarding the transfer, successors in interest,
	      or assignment of Necessary Claims will be satisfied
	      if Contributor or Licensee notifies the transferee or assignee of any patent
	      that it knows contains Necessary Claims or necessary claims under this License.
	      Nothing in this License requires Contributor to undertake a patent search.
	      If Contributor is 1) employed by or acting on behalf of an employer,
	      2) is making a Contribution under the direction or control of a third party, or
	      3) is making the Contribution as a consultant, contractor,
	      or under another similar relationship with a third party,
	      Contributor represents that they have been authorized by that party
	      to enter into this License on its behalf.
	    &lt;/li&gt;

	      is assumed by the implementer and user.
	      IN NO EVENT WILL THE CONTRIBUTORS OR LICENSEES BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY
	      FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY FORM OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
	      OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND
	      WITH RESPECT TO THIS DELIVERABLE OR ITS GOVERNING AGREEMENT,
	      WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE,
	      AND WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER MEMBER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.&amp;quot;
	    &lt;/li&gt;

Specification’s repository’s Notices.md file by the Implementer’s
authorized representative, including the Implementer’s name, authorized
individual and system identifier, and Specification version.

2.1.4. Defensive Termination. If any Licensee files or maintains a
claim in a court asserting that a Necessary Claim is infringed by an
Implementation, any licenses granted under this License to the Licensee
are immediately terminated unless 1) that claim is directly in response
to a claim against Licensee regarding an Implementation, or 2) that claim
was brought to enforce the terms of this License, including intervention
in a third-party action by a Licensee.

2.1.5. Additional Conditions. This License is not an assurance (i)
that any of Contributor’s copyrights or issued patent claims cover
an Implementation of the Specification or are enforceable or (ii) that
an Implementation of the Specification would not infringe intellectual
property rights of any third party.

2.2. Patent Licensing Commitment. In addition to the rights granted
in Section 2.1, Contributor agrees to grant everyone a no charge,
royalty-free license on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms
to Contributor’s Necessary Claims that are within Scope for:
1) Implementations of a Draft Specification, where such license
applies only to those Necessary Claims infringed by implementing
Contributor's Contribution(s) included in that Draft Specification,
and 2) Implementations of the Approved Specification.

This patent licensing commitment does not apply to those claims subject
to Contributor’s Exclusion Notice under Section 3.

2.3. Effect of Withdrawal. Contributor may withdraw from the Working Group
by issuing a pull request or commit providing notice of withdrawal to
the Working Group repository’s Notices.md file. All of Contributor’s

Contribution. Contributor may not issue an Exclusion Notice for any
material that has been included in a Draft Deliverable for more than 45
days prior to the date of that Contribution.

3.2. As a Result of a Draft Specification Becoming an Approved
Specification. Prior to the adoption of a Draft Specification as an
Approved Specification, Contributor may exclude Necessary Claims from
its licensing commitments under this Agreement by issuing an Exclusion
Notice. Contributor may not issue an Exclusion Notice for patents that
were eligible to have been excluded pursuant to Section 3.1.

4. Source Code License. Any source code developed by the Working Group is

with other participants in various lines of business and that it is
therefore imperative that they and their respective representatives
act in a manner that does not violate any applicable antitrust laws and
regulations. This License does not restrict any Contributor from engaging
in similar specification development projects. Each Contributor may
design, develop, manufacture, acquire or market competitive deliverables,
products, and services, and conduct its business, in whatever way it
chooses. No Contributor is obligated to announce or market any products
or services. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Contributors agree not to have any discussion relating to any product
pricing, methods or channels of product distribution, division of markets,
allocation of customers or any other topic that should not be discussed
among competitors under the auspices of the Working Group.

any third party materials in any Contribution unless those materials are
available under terms that do not conflict with this License. IN ALL OTHER
RESPECTS ITS CONTRIBUTIONS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." The entire risk as to
implementing or otherwise using the Contribution or the Specification
is assumed by the implementer and user. Except as stated herein,
CONTRIBUTOR AND LICENSEE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES (EXPRESS,
IMPLIED, OR OTHERWISE), INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
NON-INFRINGEMENT, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, CONDITIONS OF QUALITY,
OR TITLE, RELATED TO THE CONTRIBUTION OR THE SPECIFICATION. IN NO EVENT
WILL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY
FORM OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF
ANY CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO
THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. Any obligations regarding
the transfer, successors in interest, or assignment of Necessary Claims
will be satisfied if Contributor or Licensee notifies the transferee
or assignee of any patent that it knows contains Necessary Claims or
necessary claims under this License. Nothing in this License requires
Contributor to undertake a patent search. If Contributor is 1) employed by
or acting on behalf of an employer, 2) is making a Contribution under the
direction or control of a third party, or 3) is making the Contribution
as a consultant, contractor, or under another similar relationship with
a third party, Contributor represents that they have been authorized by
that party to enter into this License on its behalf.
