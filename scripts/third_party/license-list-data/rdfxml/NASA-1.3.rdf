                     Contributor, the addition of such Modification causes the combination to be covered by the

                               code, Recipient must also make the source code freely available, and must provide with
                               each copy of the Subject Software information on how to obtain the source code in a
                               reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

                     must identify itself as the originator of its Modification in a manner that reasonably allows
                     subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Modification. In fulfillment of these
                     requirements, Contributor must include a file (e.g., a change log file) that describes the
                     alterations made and the date of the alterations, identifies Contributor as originator of the
                     alterations, and consents to characterization of the alterations as a Modification, for
                     example, by including a statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly,
                     from Original Software provided by Government Agency. Once consent is granted, it may not
                     thereafter be revoked.

                    A Contributor may add its own copyright notice to the Subject Software. Once a copyright notice
                     has been added to the Subject Software, a Recipient may not remove it without the express
                     permission of the Contributor who added the notice.
                &lt;/li&gt;

                    A Recipient may not make any representation in the Subject Software or in any promotional,
                     advertising or other material that may be construed as an endorsement by Government Agency or
                     by any prior Recipient of any product or service provided by Recipient, or that may seek to
                     obtain commercial advantage by the fact of Government Agency&amp;apos;s or a prior
                     Recipient&amp;apos;s participation in this Agreement.

                    In an effort to track usage and maintain accurate records of the Subject Software, each
                     Recipient, upon receipt of the Subject Software, is requested to register with Government
                     Agency by visiting the following website: &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; _______________&lt;/var&gt;. Recipient&amp;apos;s name and personal
                     information shall be used for statistical purposes only. Once a Recipient makes a Modification
                     available, it is requested that the Recipient inform Government Agency at the web site
                     provided above how to access the Modification.
                    &lt;p&gt;[Alternative paragraph for use when a web site for release and monitoring of subject software
                     will not be supported by releasing Government Agency] In an effort to track usage and maintain
                     accurate records of the Subject Software, each Recipient, upon receipt of the Subject
                     Software, is requested to provide Government Agency, by e-mail to the Government Agency Point
                     of Contact listed in clause 5.F., the following information: &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; _______________&lt;/var&gt;. Recipient&amp;apos;s name and
                     personal information shall be used for statistical purposes only. Once a Recipient makes a
                     Modification available, it is requested that the Recipient inform Government Agency, by e-mail
                     to the Government Agency Point of Contact listed in clause 5.F., how to access the
                     Modification.&lt;/p&gt;

                    Each Contributor represents that that its Modification is believed to be Contributor&amp;apos;s
                     original creation and does not violate any existing agreements, regulations, statutes or
                     rules, and further that Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
                     Agreement.
                &lt;/li&gt;

                    A Recipient may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity and/or
                     liability obligations to one or more other Recipients of the Subject Software. A Recipient may
                     do so, however, only on its own behalf and not on behalf of Government Agency or any other
                     Recipient. Such a Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
                     indemnity and/or liability obligation is offered by that Recipient alone. Further, such
                     Recipient agrees to indemnify Government Agency and every other Recipient for any liability
                     incurred by them as a result of warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability offered by such
                     Recipient.

                    A Recipient may create a Larger Work by combining Subject Software with separate software not
                     governed by the terms of this agreement and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In
                     such case, the Recipient must make sure Subject Software, or portions thereof, included in the
                     Larger Work is subject to this Agreement.
                &lt;/li&gt;

                    Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein, Recipient is hereby put on notice that export of
                     any goods or technical data from the United States may require some form of export license
                     from the U.S. Government. Failure to obtain necessary export licenses may result in criminal
                     liability under U.S. laws. Government Agency neither represents that a license shall not be
                     required nor that, if required, it shall be issued. Nothing granted herein provides any such
                     export license.

                     PRODUCTS OR ANY OTHER APPLICATIONS RESULTING FROM USE OF THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE. FURTHER,
                     GOVERNMENT AGENCY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND LIABILITIES REGARDING THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE, IF
                     PRESENT IN THE ORIGINAL SOFTWARE, AND DISTRIBUTES IT &amp;quot;AS IS.&amp;quot;

                     GOVERNMENT, ITS CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS, AS WELL AS ANY PRIOR RECIPIENT. IF
                     RECIPIENT&amp;apos;S USE OF THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE RESULTS IN ANY LIABILITIES, DEMANDS, DAMAGES,
                     EXPENSES OR LOSSES ARISING FROM SUCH USE, INCLUDING ANY DAMAGES FROM PRODUCTS BASED ON, OR
                     RESULTING FROM, RECIPIENT&amp;apos;S USE OF THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE, RECIPIENT SHALL INDEMNIFY AND

                     MATTER SHALL BE THE IMMEDIATE, UNILATERAL TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.
                &lt;/li&gt;

                    Termination: This Agreement and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if a
                     Recipient fails to comply with these terms and conditions, and fails to cure such
                     noncompliance within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of such noncompliance. Upon
                     termination, a Recipient agrees to immediately cease use and distribution of the Subject
                     Software. All sublicenses to the Subject Software properly granted by the breaching Recipient
                     shall survive any such termination of this Agreement.

                    &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; B.&lt;/var&gt;
                    Severability: If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
                     law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this
                     Agreement.

                     purposes, including, but not limited to, determining the validity of this Agreement, the
                     meaning of its provisions and the rights, obligations and remedies of the parties.

                     parties relating to release of the Subject Software and may not be superseded, modified or
                     amended except by further written agreement duly executed by the parties.

                    Binding Authority: By accepting and using the Subject Software under this Agreement, a Recipient
                     affirms its authority to bind the Recipient to all terms and conditions of this Agreement and
