This is the Community Data License Agreement - Permissive, Version 1.0 ("Agreement"). Data is provided to You under this Agreement by each of the Data Providers. Your exercise of any of the rights and permissions granted below constitutes Your acceptance and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

The benefits that each Data Provider receives from making Data available and that You receive from Data or otherwise under these terms and conditions shall be deemed sufficient consideration for the formation of this Agreement. Accordingly, Data Provider(s) and You (the "Parties") agree as follows:

      <<var;name="bullet";original="1.1";match=".{0,20}">> "Add" means to supplement Data with Your own or someone else's Data, resulting in Your "Additions." Additions do not include Results.

      <<var;name="bullet";original="1.2";match=".{0,20}">> "Computational Use" means Your analysis (through the use of computational devices or otherwise) or other interpretation of Data. By way of example and not limitation, "Computational Use" includes the application of any computational analytical technique, the purpose of which is the analysis of any Data in digital form to generate information about Data such as patterns, trends, correlations, inferences, insights and attributes.

      <<var;name="bullet";original="1.3";match=".{0,20}">> "Data" means the information (including copyrightable information, such as images or text), collectively or individually, whether created or gathered by a Data Provider or an Entity acting on its behalf, to which rights are granted under this Agreement.

      <<var;name="bullet";original="1.4";match=".{0,20}">> "Data Provider" means any Entity (including any employee or contractor of such Entity authorized to Publish Data on behalf of such Entity) that Publishes Data under this Agreement prior to Your Receiving it.

      <<var;name="bullet";original="1.5";match=".{0,20}">> "Enhanced Data" means the subset of Data that You Publish and that is composed of (a) Your Additions and/or (b) Modifications to Data You have received under this Agreement.
