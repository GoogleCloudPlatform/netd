                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; (1)&lt;/var&gt;
              The following must be also Redistributed together with the Derived Program, or be made
                 available online or by means of mailing mechanisms in exchange for a cost which does not
                 exceed the total costs of postage, storage medium and handling fees:
              
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; (a)&lt;/var&gt;
                  a copy of the Derived Program; and
                &lt;/li&gt;
                     
&lt;li&gt;
                        &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; (b)&lt;/var&gt;
                  any additional file created by the font developing program in the course of creating the
                     Derived Program that can be used for further modification of the Derived Program, if
                     any.
                &lt;/li&gt;
                  
&lt;/ul&gt;
               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; (2)&lt;/var&gt;
              It is required to also Redistribute means to enable recipients of the Derived Program to
                 replace the Derived Program with the Licensed Program first released under this License
                 (the &amp;quot;Original Program&amp;quot;). Such means may be to provide a difference file from
                 the Original Program, or instructions setting out a method to replace the Derived Program
                 with the Original Program.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; (3)&lt;/var&gt;
              The Recipient must license the Derived Program under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; (4)&lt;/var&gt;
              No one may use or include the name of the Licensed Program as a program name, font name or
                 file name of the Derived Program.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; (5)&lt;/var&gt;
              Any material to be made available online or by means of mailing a medium to satisfy the
                 requirements of this paragraph may be provided, verbatim, by any party wishing to do
                 so.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
          If the Recipient Redistributes the Licensed Program pursuant to Paragraph 6 of the preceding
             Article, the Recipient shall meet all of the following conditions:
          
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; (1)&lt;/var&gt;
              The Recipient may not change the name of the Licensed Program.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; (2)&lt;/var&gt;
              The Recipient may not alter or otherwise modify the Licensed Program.
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; (3)&lt;/var&gt;
              The Recipient must attach a copy of this Agreement to the Licensed Program.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;

             ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE INSTALLATION, USE, THE REPRODUCTION OR OTHER EXPLOITATION OF THE

             IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
          The Licensor is under no obligation to respond to any technical questions or inquiries, or
             provide any other user support in connection with the installation, use or the Reproduction
             and Other Exploitation of the Licensed Program or Derived Programs thereof.

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
          The term of this Agreement shall begin from the time of receipt of the Licensed Program by the
             Recipient and shall continue as long as the Recipient retains any such Licensed Program in any
             way.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
          Notwithstanding the provision set forth in the preceding Paragraph, in the event of the breach of
             any of the provisions set forth in this Agreement by the Recipient, this Agreement shall
             automatically terminate without any notice. In the case of such termination, the Recipient may
             not use or conduct Reproduction and Other Exploitation of the Licensed Program or a Derived
             Program: provided that such termination shall not affect any rights of any other Recipient
             receiving the Licensed Program or the Derived Program from such Recipient who breached this
             Agreement.
        &lt;/li&gt;
