<ul style="list-style:none">
               
<li>
                  <var class="replacable-license-text"> 1.</var>
              You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and all
                 portions (including modifications) of the Program
                 included in the Derivative Work (provided that this

<li>
                  <var class="replacable-license-text"> 2.</var>
              The Derivative Work does not include any work licensed
                 under the GPL other than the Program;
            </li>
               
<li>
                  <var class="replacable-license-text"> 3.</var>

                  <var class="replacable-license-text"> 4.</var>

                 executable form with the complete corresponding
                 machine-readable source code on the same medium and
                 under the same FOSS license applying to the object
                 code or executable forms;
            </li>
               
<li>
                  <var class="replacable-license-text"> 5.</var>
              All works that are aggregated with the Program or the

                 not derivative works of the Program, Derivative Work
                 or FOSS Application, and must reasonably be considered
                 independent and separate works.
