                 distributions of the Covered Code in source code form, the Notice must appear in every file
                 that can include a text comments field; in executable form, the Notice and a copy of this

                 (1) this License; (2) a license identical to this License but for only such changes as are
                 necessary in order to clarify Recipient&amp;apos;s role as licensor of Modifications, without
                 derogation of any of SGI&amp;apos;s rights; and/or (3) a license of Recipient&amp;apos;s choosing, containing
                 terms different from this License, provided that the license terms include this Section 3 and
                 Sections 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, and 13, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other
                 terms of such license. If Recipient elects to use any license other than this License,
                 Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any of its terms which differ from this License
                 are offered by Recipient alone, and not by SGI.

             Recipient breaches any term herein and fails to cure such breach within 30 days thereof. Any
             sublicense to the Covered Code that is properly granted shall survive any termination of this
             License, absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions that, by their nature,
             must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;

             control laws, regulations, and executive orders, of the U.S. government and other countries.

             contributorily) the rights (including patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark or other
             intellectual property rights of any kind) of any other person or entity or (ii) breaches any
             representation or warranty, express, implied or statutory, to which, under any applicable law,
             it might be deemed to have been subject.

             Covered Code and/or functionality wholly or partially infringes the third party&amp;apos;s intellectual
             property rights, Recipient will promptly notify SGI of such claim.
        &lt;/li&gt;

          Versions of the License. SGI may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to
             time, each with a distinguishing version number. Once Covered Code has been published under a
             particular version of the License, Recipient may, for the duration of the license, continue to
