As far as I am concerned, the code I have written for this software can be used freely for any purpose. Any derived versions of this software must be clearly marked as such, and if the derived work is incompatible with the protocol description in the RFC file, it must be called by a name other than "ssh" or "Secure Shell".

[Tatu continues]

However, I am not implying to give any licenses to any patents or copyrights held by third parties, and the software includes parts that are not under my direct control. As far as I know, all included source code is used in accordance with the relevant license agreements and can be used freely for any purpose (the GNU license being the most restrictive); see below for details.

[However, none of that term is relevant at this point in time. All of these restrictively licenced software components which he talks about have been removed from OpenSSH, i.e.,

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="-";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; RSA is no longer included, found in the OpenSSL library

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="-";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; IDEA is no longer included, its use is deprecated

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="-";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; DES is now external, in the OpenSSL library

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="-";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; GMP is no longer used, and instead we call BN code from OpenSSL

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="-";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Zlib is now external, in a library

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="-";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; The make-ssh-known-hosts script is no longer included

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="-";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; TSS has been removed

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="-";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; MD5 is now external, in the OpenSSL library

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="-";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; RC4 support has been replaced with ARC4 support from OpenSSL

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="-";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Blowfish is now external, in the OpenSSL library
