   <<var;name="bullet";original="(i)";match=".{0,20}">> the header files of the Library have not been modified; and

   <<var;name="bullet";original="(ii)";match=".{0,20}">> the incorporated material is limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts, accessors, macros, inline functions and templates; and

   <<var;name="bullet";original="(iii)";match=".{0,20}">> you comply with the terms of Section 6 of the GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1.

Moreover, you may apply this exception to a modified version of the Library, provided that such modification does not involve copying material from the Library into the modified Library's header files unless such material is limited to

   <<var;name="bullet";original="(i)";match=".{0,20}">> numerical parameters;

   <<var;name="bullet";original="(ii)";match=".{0,20}">> data structure layouts;

   <<var;name="bullet";original="(iii)";match=".{0,20}">> accessors; and

   <<var;name="bullet";original="(iv)";match=".{0,20}">> small macros, templates and inline functions of five lines or less in length.

Furthermore, you are not required to apply this additional permission to a modified version of the Library.
