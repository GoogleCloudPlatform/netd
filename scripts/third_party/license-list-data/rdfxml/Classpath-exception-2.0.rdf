      &lt;p&gt;Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules
         is making a combined work based on this library. Thus, the
         terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License cover
         the whole combination.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library
         give you permission to link this library with independent
         modules to produce an executable, regardless of the license
         terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute
         the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided
         that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the
         terms and conditions of the license of that module. An
         independent module is a module which is not derived from or
         based on this library. If you modify this library, you may
         extend this exception to your version of the library, but you
         are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so,
         delete this exception statement from your version.&lt;/p&gt;
