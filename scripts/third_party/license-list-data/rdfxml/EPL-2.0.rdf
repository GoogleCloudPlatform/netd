THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; DEFINITIONS

   "Contribution" means:

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content Distributed under this Agreement, and

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; in the case of each subsequent Contributor:

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="i)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; changes to the Program, and

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="ii)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; additions to the Program;

      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that are not Modified Works.

   "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

   "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

   "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

   "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.

   "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified Works shall not include works that contain only declarations, interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program or Modified Works thereof.

   "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

   "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

   "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial Contributor.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; GRANT OF RIGHTS

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="c)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="d)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="e)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; REQUIREMENTS

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.1";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license:

            &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="i)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;

            &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="ii)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;

            &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="iii)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code under section 3.2; and

            &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="iv)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.2";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and

         &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.3";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

   Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

   For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; NO WARRANTY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

   EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="7.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; GENERAL

   If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

   All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.

   Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

   Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice

   "This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}."

   Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

   If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

   You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

				&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Licensed

				&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Derivative
					Works&amp;quot;
					shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or
					other
					form, that is
					based on (or derived from) the Program and for
					which the
					editorial
					revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other
					modifications
					represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
				&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Modified
					Works&amp;quot;

					the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any
					new
					file
					in

				&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
				GRANT OF RIGHTS
				
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
					
&lt;li&gt;
						&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
						Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
						grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
						copyright
						license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
						publicly display,
						publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the
						Contribution of
						such
						Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
					&lt;/li&gt;
					
&lt;li&gt;
						&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
						Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
						grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
						license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
						import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such
						Contributor,
						if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent
						license shall
						apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
						Program if,
						at the time the Contribution is added by the
						Contributor, such
						addition of the Contribution causes such
						combination to be covered
						by the Licensed Patents. The patent
						license shall not apply to any
						other combinations which include the
						Contribution. No hardware per
						se is licensed hereunder.
					&lt;/li&gt;
					
&lt;li&gt;
						&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; c)&lt;/var&gt;
						Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
						licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
						provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
						patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
						Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
						brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
						property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
						rights
						and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
						assumes sole
						responsibility to secure any other intellectual
						property rights
						needed,
						if any. For example, if a third party patent
						license is required to
						allow Recipient to Distribute the Program,
						it is Recipient&amp;apos;s
						responsibility to acquire that license
						before distributing the
						Program.
					&lt;/li&gt;
					
&lt;li&gt;
						&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; d)&lt;/var&gt;
						Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
						sufficient
						copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
						the copyright
						license set forth in this Agreement.
					&lt;/li&gt;
					
&lt;li&gt;
						&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; e)&lt;/var&gt;
						Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor
						makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set
						forth
						in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient&amp;apos;s
						receipt of
						the
						Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if
						permitted under
						the terms of Section 3).
					&lt;/li&gt;

				REQUIREMENTS
				
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
					
&lt;li&gt;
						&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 3.1&lt;/var&gt;
						If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
						
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
							
&lt;li&gt;
								&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
								the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
								accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
								the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the
								Program
								is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients
								how to
								obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium
								customarily
								used for software exchange; and
							&lt;/li&gt;
							
&lt;li&gt;
								&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
								the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
								different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
								
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
									
&lt;li&gt;
										&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; i)&lt;/var&gt;
										effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
										warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
										warranties
										or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
										implied
										warranties
										or conditions of merchantability and fitness
										for a particular
										purpose;
									&lt;/li&gt;
									
&lt;li&gt;
										&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; ii)&lt;/var&gt;
										effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
										liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,

										and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
									&lt;/li&gt;
									
&lt;li&gt;
										&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; iii)&lt;/var&gt;
										does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients&amp;apos; rights
										in the
										Source Code under section 3.2; and
									&lt;/li&gt;
									
&lt;li&gt;
										&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; iv)&lt;/var&gt;
										requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
										party
										to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of
										this
										section 3.
									&lt;/li&gt;
								
&lt;/ul&gt;
							&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
								&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
								it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
								Program (i)
								is combined with other material in a separate file or
								files made
								available
								under a Secondary License, and (ii) the
								initial Contributor attached
								to
								the Source Code the notice
								described in Exhibit A of this
								Agreement,
								then the Program may be
								made available under the terms of such
								Secondary Licenses, and
							&lt;/li&gt;
							
&lt;li&gt;
								&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
								a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the

&lt;/ul&gt;
					&lt;/li&gt;
					
&lt;li&gt;
						&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 3.3&lt;/var&gt;
						Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
						trademark,
						attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
						limitations of liability
						(&amp;quot;notices&amp;quot;)
						contained within the Program
						from any copy of the Program which

					&lt;/li&gt;
				
&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/li&gt;
			
&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
				COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
				&lt;p&gt;Commercial
					distributors of software may accept certain
					responsibilities
					with
					respect to end users, business partners and the
					like. While this
					license is intended to facilitate the commercial
					use of the
					Program, the
					Contributor who includes the Program in a
					commercial
					product offering should
					do so in a manner which does not
					create
					potential liability for
					other
					Contributors. Therefore, if a
					Contributor includes the Program in a
					commercial product offering,
					such Contributor (&amp;quot;Commercial
					Contributor&amp;quot;)
					hereby agrees to defend
					and indemnify every other Contributor
					(&amp;quot;Indemnified
					Contributor&amp;quot;)
					against any losses, damages and costs
					(collectively &amp;quot;Losses&amp;quot;)
					arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions
					brought by a
					third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
					extent
					caused
					by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
					connection
					with its distribution of the Program in a commercial
					product offering.
					The obligations in this section do not apply to
					any claims or
					Losses relating
					to any actual or alleged intellectual
					property infringement. In
					order to
					qualify, an Indemnified
					Contributor must: a) promptly notify the
					Commercial Contributor in
					writing of such claim, and b) allow the
					Commercial
					Contributor to
					control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in,
					the
					defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified
					Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.
				&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;For example, a Contributor might include the Program
					in a
					commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is
					then a
					Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes
					performance
					claims, or offers warranties related to Product X,
					those
					performance
					claims
					and warranties are such Commercial
					Contributor&amp;apos;s responsibility
					alone.
					Under this section, the
					Commercial Contributor would have to defend
					claims
					against the other
					Contributors related to those performance claims and
					warranties,
					and
					if a court requires any other Contributor to pay
					any damages
					as
					a
					result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
				&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/li&gt;
			
&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
				NO WARRANTY
				&lt;p&gt;EXCEPT
					AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
					PERMITTED
					BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN &amp;quot;AS
					IS&amp;quot;
					BASIS, WITHOUT
					WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS
					OR IMPLIED INCLUDING,
					WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
					CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
					NON-INFRINGEMENT,
					MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
					FOR
					A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is
					solely responsible for
					determining the appropriateness of using and
					distributing the
					Program and assumes all risks associated with its
					exercise of
					rights
					under this Agreement, including but not limited
					to the
					risks
					and costs
					of program errors, compliance with applicable laws,
					damage
					to or loss
					of data, programs or equipment, and
					unavailability or
					interruption of
					operations.
				&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/li&gt;
			
&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
				DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
				&lt;p&gt;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE
					EXTENT PERMITTED
					BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
					CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE
					ANY
					LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
					INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,
					OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING
					WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
					PROFITS),
					HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY
					OF
					LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
					STRICT
					LIABILITY, OR TORT
					(INCLUDING
					NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
					OUT OF THE
					USE OR
					DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF
					ANY RIGHTS
					GRANTED
					HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
					DAMAGES.
				&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/li&gt;
			
&lt;li&gt;
				&lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
				GENERAL
				&lt;p&gt;If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable
					under
					applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
					enforceability of the
					remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and
					without further
					action by the
					parties hereto, such provision shall
					be
					reformed to the minimum extent
					necessary to make such provision
					valid and enforceable.
				&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
					(including a
					cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
					that
					the Program itself
					(excluding combinations of the Program with
					other
					software or
					hardware)
					infringes such Recipient&amp;apos;s
					patent(s), then
					such Recipient&amp;apos;s
					rights granted
					under Section
					2(b) shall
					terminate as of the date such litigation is
					filed.
				&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;All Recipient&amp;apos;s rights under this Agreement shall terminate
					if it fails to
					comply with any of the material terms or conditions
					of this Agreement
					and
					does not cure such failure in a reasonable
					period of time after
					becoming
					aware of such noncompliance. If all
					Recipient&amp;apos;s rights under this
					Agreement
					terminate, Recipient
					agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program
					as soon as
					reasonably practicable. However, Recipient&amp;apos;s
					obligations under
					this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to
					the
					Program shall continue and survive.
				&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
					Agreement,
					but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
					copyrighted and
					may
					only be modified in the following manner. The
					Agreement Steward
					reserves
					the right to publish new versions
					(including revisions) of this
					Agreement
					from time to time. No one
					other than the Agreement Steward has the
					right
					to modify this
					Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial
					Agreement
					Steward.
					The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as
					the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new
					version of
					the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version
					number. The
					Program
					(including Contributions) may always be
					Distributed subject to the version
					of the Agreement under which it
					was received. In addition, after a
					new
					version of the Agreement is
					published, Contributor may elect to
					Distribute
					the Program
					(including
					its Contributions) under the new version.
				&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,
					Recipient
					receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual
					property of any
					Contributor under this Agreement, whether
					expressly,
					by
					implication,
					estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the
					Program not
					expressly granted
					under this Agreement are reserved.
					Nothing in this
					Agreement is
					intended
					to be enforceable by any
					entity that is not a
					Contributor or
					Recipient.
					No third-party
					beneficiary rights are
					created under this Agreement.
				&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/li&gt;
			
&lt;li&gt;
				Exhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This
					Source Code may also be made available under the following
					Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set
					forth
					in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name
					license(s),
					version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions
					here}.&amp;quot;
				&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit
					A
					is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary
					Licenses.
				&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a
					particular file,
					then You may include the notice in a location (such
					as a LICENSE file
					in
					a
					relevant directory) where a recipient would be
					likely to look for
					such a notice.
				&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.

    <spdx:licenseText>Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (“AGREEMENT”). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

1. DEFINITIONS
“Contribution” means:

a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content Distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution “originates” from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that are not Modified Works.
“Contributor” means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.

“Licensed Patents” mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.

“Program” means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

“Recipient” means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.

“Derivative Works” shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.

“Modified Works” shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified Works shall not include works that contain only declarations, interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program or Modified Works thereof.

“Distribute” means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

“Source Code” means the form of a Program preferred for making modifications, including but not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

“Secondary License” means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial Contributor.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
3. REQUIREMENTS
3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:

a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange; and
b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements of this section 3.
3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:

a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability (‘notices’) contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.

4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (“Commercial Contributor”) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively “Losses”) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. GENERAL
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version.

Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.

Exhibit A – Form of Secondary Licenses Notice
“This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s), version(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.”

Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
