      &lt;div class="optional-license-text"&gt; 
         &lt;p&gt;Before we get to the text of the license, lets just review what the license says in simple terms:&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;It allows you to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
            freely download and use ImageMagick software, in whole or in part, for personal, company
            internal, or commercial purposes;
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
            use ImageMagick software in packages or distributions that you create;
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
            link against a library under a different license;
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
            link code under a different license against a library under this license;
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
            merge code into a work under a different license;
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
            extend patent grants to any code using code under this license;
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
            and extend patent protection.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It forbids you to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
            redistribute any piece of ImageMagick-originated software without proper attribution;
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
            use any marks owned by ImageMagick Studio LLC in any way that might state or imply that
               ImageMagick Studio LLC endorses your distribution;
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
            use any marks owned by ImageMagick Studio LLC in any way that might state or imply that you
               created the ImageMagick software in question.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It requires you to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
            include a copy of the license in any redistribution you may make that includes ImageMagick software;
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
            provide clear attribution to ImageMagick Studio LLC for any distributions that include
               ImageMagick software.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It does not require you to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
            include the source of the ImageMagick software itself, or of any modifications you may have
               made to it, in any redistribution you may assemble that includes it;
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
            submit changes that you make to the software back to the ImageMagick Studio LLC (though such
               feedback is encouraged).
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A few other clarifications include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
            ImageMagick is freely available without charge;
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
            you may include ImageMagick on a DVD as long as you comply with the terms of the license;
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
            you can give modified code away for free or sell it under the terms of the ImageMagick
               license or distribute the result under a different license, but you need to acknowledge
               the use of the ImageMagick software;
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
            the license is compatible with the GPL V3.
          &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;li&gt;
               &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; *&lt;/var&gt;
            when exporting the ImageMagick software, review its export classification.
          &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Terms and Conditions for Use, Reproduction, and Distribution&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The legally binding and authoritative terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution of
         ImageMagick follow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
          Definitions.
          &lt;p&gt;License shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution as defined by

            &lt;p&gt;Licensor shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner that is
             granting the License.&lt;/p&gt;

             controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. For the purposes of this
             definition, control means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or

             percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such
             entity.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;You (or Your) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Source form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not limited to

            &lt;p&gt;Work shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available under
             the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
             (an example is provided in the Appendix below).&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Derivative Works shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on (or
             derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or
             other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of
             this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely
             link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Contribution shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work and
             any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
             submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or
             Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this
             definition, &amp;quot;submitted&amp;quot; means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to
             the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic
             mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or
             on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding
             communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright
             owner as Not a Contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Contributor shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a
             Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
          Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
             hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
             irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
             publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or
             Object form.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
          Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
             hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
             irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
             transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such
             Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of
             their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
             institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
             lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
             direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this
             License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
          Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof
             in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
             meet the following conditions:
        
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; a.&lt;/var&gt;
            You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; b.&lt;/var&gt;
            You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; c.&lt;/var&gt;
            You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all
               copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
               excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
          &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; d.&lt;/var&gt;
            If the Work includes a &amp;quot;NOTICE&amp;quot; text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative
               Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices
               contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part
               of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text
               file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation,
               if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
               Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
               of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You
               may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute,
               alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such
               additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
           &lt;/li&gt;
           
&lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or
               different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
               modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
               in this License.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
          Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
             intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the
             terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
             Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate
             license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
          Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service
             marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use
             in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
          Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
             provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT
             WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
             limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
             FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
             appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
             exercise of permissions under this License.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
          Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
             negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
             grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for
             damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
             character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work
             (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
             malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
             been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;
          Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works
             thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
             indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
             in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
             responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
             defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
             against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
             liability.
        &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;div class="optional-license-text"&gt; 
         &lt;p&gt;How to Apply the License to your Work&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;p&gt;To apply the ImageMagick License to your work, attach the following boilerplate notice, with the fields
         enclosed by brackets &amp;quot;[]&amp;quot; replaced with your own identifying information (don&amp;apos;t include the brackets).
         The text should be enclosed in the appropriate comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend
         that a file or class name and description of purpose be included on the same &amp;quot;printed page&amp;quot; as the
         copyright notice for easier identification within third-party archives.&lt;/p&gt;

    <spdx:standardLicenseTemplate>&lt;&lt;beginOptional&gt;&gt;Before we get to the text of the license, lets just review what the license says in simple terms:
