PREAMBLE

The purpose of this Free Software Licensing Agreement is to grant users the right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this license within the framework of an "open source" distribution model.

The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain obligations for users so as to ensure that this status is retained for subsequent redistribution operations.

As a counterpart to the access to the source code and rights to copy, modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only with a limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.

In this respect, it is brought to the user's attention that the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user given its nature of Free Software, that may mean that it is complicated to manipulate, and that also therefore means that it is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the Software's suitability as regards their requirements in conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published, provided it is not altered, and that no Articles are either added or removed herefrom.

This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of the economic rights decides to submit the operation thereof to its provisions.

         &lt;p&gt;FREE SOFTWARE LICENSING AGREEMENT CeCILL&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="optional-license-text"&gt; 
         &lt;p&gt;Notice
        &lt;br /&gt;

This Agreement is a free software license that is the result of discussions between its authors in
             order to ensure compliance with the two main principles guiding its drafting:
            
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; -&lt;/var&gt;
                  firstly, its conformity with French law, both as regards the law of torts and intellectual
                     property law, and the protection that it offers to authors and the holders of economic rights
                     over software.
                &lt;/li&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; -&lt;/var&gt;
                  secondly, compliance with the principles for the distribution of free software: access to source
                     codes, extended user-rights.
                &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
         &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The following bodies are the authors of this license CeCILL (Ce : CEA, C : CNRS, I : INRIA, LL : Logiciel
         Libre):
            
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;

                &lt;/li&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique - CNRS, a public scientific and technological establishment,
                     having its principal place of business at 3 rue Michel-Ange 75794 Paris cedex 16, France.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;PREAMBLE&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;The purpose of this Free Software Licensing Agreement is to grant users the right to modify and
                 redistribute the software governed by this license within the framework of an &amp;quot;open source&amp;quot;
                 distribution model.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain obligations for users so as to ensure that
                 this status is retained for subsequent redistribution operations.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;As a counterpart to the access to the source code and rights to copy, modify and redistribute granted by
                 the license, users are provided only with a limited warranty and the software&amp;apos;s author, the
                 holder of the economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;In this respect, it is brought to the user&amp;apos;s attention that the risks associated with loading,
                 using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user given its nature of Free
                 Software, that may mean that it is complicated to manipulate, and that also therefore means that it is
                 reserved for developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are
                 therefore encouraged to load and test the Software&amp;apos;s suitability as regards their requirements in
                 conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more generally, to
                 use and operate it in the same conditions of security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and
                 published, provided it is not altered, and that no Articles are either added or removed herefrom.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of the economic rights decides to
                 submit the operation thereof to its provisions.&lt;/p&gt;

	        &lt;/li&gt;

          Subject to the provisions of Article 8.2, should the Licensor fail to fulfill all or part of its
             obligations hereunder, the Licensee shall be entitled to claim compensation for the direct
             loss suffered as a result of a fault on the part of the Licensor, subject to providing
             evidence of it.
        &lt;/li&gt;

          The Licensor&amp;apos;s liability is limited to the commitments made under this Licensing Agreement
             and shall not be incurred as a result , in particular: (i) of loss due the Licensee&amp;apos;s
             total or partial failure to fulfill its obligations, (ii) direct or consequential loss due to
             the Software&amp;apos;s use or performance that is suffered by the Licensee, when the latter is a
             professional using said Software for professional purposes and (iii) consequential loss due to
             the Software&amp;apos;s use or performance. The Parties expressly agree that any or all pecuniary
             or business loss (i.e. loss of data, loss of profits, operating loss, loss of customers or
             orders, opportunity cost, any disturbance to business activities) or any or all legal
             proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a third party, shall constitute consequential
             loss and shall not provide entitlement to any or all compensation from the Licensor.
        &lt;/li&gt;

                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 9.1.&lt;/var&gt;
          The Licensee acknowledges that the current situation as regards scientific and technical know-how
             at the time when the Software was distributed did not enable all possible uses to be tested
             and verified, nor for the presence of any or all faults to be detected. In this respect, the
             Licensee&amp;apos;s attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using,
             modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software that are reserved for experienced
             users.
          &lt;p&gt;The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means, the product&amp;apos;s
             suitability for its requirements, its due and proper functioning, and for ensuring that it
             shall not cause damage to either persons or property.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 9.2.&lt;/var&gt;
          The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled to grant all the rights on the
             Software (including in particular the rights set forth in Article 5 hereof over the
             Software).
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 9.3.&lt;/var&gt;
          The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied &amp;quot;as is&amp;quot; by the Licensor without
             any or all other express or tacit warranty, other than that provided for in Article 9.2 and,
             in particular, without any or all warranty as to its market value, its secured, innovative or
             relevant nature.
          &lt;p&gt;Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free from any or all error, that
             it shall operate continuously, that it shall be compatible with the Licensee&amp;apos;s own
             equipment and its software configuration, nor that it shall meet the Licensee&amp;apos;s
             requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 9.4.&lt;/var&gt;
          The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the Software does not infringe any
             or all third party intellectual right relating to a patent, software or to any or all other
             property right. Moreover, the Licensor shall not hold the Licensee harmless against any or all
             proceedings for infringement that may be instituted in respect of the use, modification and
             redistribution of the Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against
             the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal assistance for its
             defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be decided upon on a case-by-case basis
             between the relevant Licensor and the Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The
             Licensor disclaims any or all liability as regards the Licensee&amp;apos;s use of the
             Software&amp;apos;s name. No warranty shall be provided as regards the existence of prior rights
             over the name of the Software and as regards the existence of a trademark.
        &lt;/li&gt;

          In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations hereunder, the Licensor may
             automatically terminate this Agreement thirty (30) days after notice has been sent to the
             Licensee and has remained ineffective.
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 10.2.&lt;/var&gt;
          The Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be authorized to use, modify or
             distribute the Software. However, any or all licenses that it may have granted prior to
             termination of the Agreement shall remain valid subject to their having been granted in
             compliance with the terms and conditions hereof.
        &lt;/li&gt;

                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 11.1.&lt;/var&gt;
          EXCUSABLE EVENTS
          &lt;p&gt;Neither Party shall be liable for any or all delay, or failure to perform the Agreement, that may
             be attributable to an event of force majeure, an act of God or an outside cause, such as,
             notably, defective functioning, or interruptions affecting the electricity or
             telecommunications networks, blocking of the network following a virus attack, the
             intervention of the government authorities, natural disasters, water damage, earthquakes,
             fire, explosions, strikes and labor unrest, war, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 11.2.&lt;/var&gt;
          The fact that either Party may fail, on one or several occasions, to invoke one or several of the
             provisions hereof, shall under no circumstances be interpreted as being a waiver by the
             interested Party of its entitlement to invoke said provision(s) subsequently.
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 11.3.&lt;/var&gt;
          The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreement, whether written or oral,
             between the Parties and having the same purpose, and constitutes the entirety of the agreement
             between said Parties concerning said purpose. No supplement or modification to the terms and
             conditions hereof shall be effective as regards the Parties unless it is made in writing and
             signed by their duly authorized representatives.
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 11.4.&lt;/var&gt;
          In the event that one or several of the provisions hereof were to conflict with a current or
             future applicable act or legislative text, said act or legislative text shall take precedence,
             and the Parties shall make the necessary amendments so as to be in compliance with said act or
             legislative text. All the other provisions shall remain effective. Similarly, the fact that a
             provision of the Agreement may be null and void, for any reason whatsoever, shall not cause
             the Agreement as a whole to be null and void.
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;

          LANGUAGE
          &lt;p&gt;The Agreement is drafted in both French and English. In the event of a conflict as regards
             construction, the French version shall be deemed authentic.&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;/li&gt;

          So as to ensure coherence, the wording of this Agreement is protected and may only be modified by
             the authors of the License, that reserve the right to periodically publish updates or new
             versions of the Agreement, each with a separate number. These subsequent versions may address
             new issues encountered by Free Software.

          Any or all Software distributed under a given version of the Agreement may only be subsequently
             distributed under the same version of the Agreement, or a subsequent version, subject to the
             provisions of article 5.3.4.
        &lt;/li&gt;

          The Agreement is governed by French law. The Parties agree to endeavor to settle the
             disagreements or disputes that may arise during the performance of the Agreement
             out-of-court.
        &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 13.2.&lt;/var&gt;
          In the absence of an out-of-court settlement within two (2) months as from their occurrence, and
             unless emergency proceedings are necessary, the disagreements or disputes shall be referred to
             the Paris Courts having jurisdiction, by the first Party to take action.
        &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
