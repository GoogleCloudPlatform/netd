                 the Initial Developer.

        &lt;/li&gt;

            Severability If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this
               License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be
               enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and
               intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and
