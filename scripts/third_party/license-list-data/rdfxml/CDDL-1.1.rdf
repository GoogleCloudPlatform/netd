                    &lt;br /&gt;

      You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that
                         alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&amp;apos;
                         rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
                         indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
                         However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
                         Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such
                         warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
                         hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
                         liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
                         warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

                &lt;/li&gt;

      You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this
                         License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
                         different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of
                         this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or
                         alter the recipient&amp;apos;s rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in
                         this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
                         different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
                         this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor.
                         You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
                         liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
                         such terms You offer.

                &lt;/li&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 3.6.&lt;/var&gt;
                  Larger Works.
                    &lt;br /&gt;

      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by
                         the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
                         a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
                         Covered Software.

                &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
          Versions of the License.
            
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 4.1.&lt;/var&gt;
                  New Versions.
                    &lt;br /&gt;

      Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this
                         License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
                         Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right
                         to modify this License.

                &lt;/li&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 4.2.&lt;/var&gt;
                  Effect of New Versions.
                    &lt;br /&gt;

      You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available
                         under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the
                         Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
                         prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent
                         version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available
                         under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the
                         Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make
                         the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the
                         License published by the license steward.

                &lt;/li&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 4.3.&lt;/var&gt;
                  Modified Versions.
                    &lt;br /&gt;

      When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original
                         Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename
                         the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
                         note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that
                         the license contains terms which differ from this License.

                &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;

          DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
            &lt;p&gt;COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; BASIS, WITHOUT
                 WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
                 WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A
                 PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
                 PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE

                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 6.1.&lt;/var&gt;
                  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply
                     with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
                     Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this
                     License shall survive.
                &lt;/li&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 6.2.&lt;/var&gt;
                  If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against
                     Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
                     assert such claim is referred to as &amp;quot;Participant&amp;quot;) alleging that the Participant
                     Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the
                     Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
                     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such
                     Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all
                     Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
                     Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice
                     period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
                     Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written
                     agreement with Participant.
                &lt;/li&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 6.3.&lt;/var&gt;
                  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that the Participant
                     Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
                     license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the
                     reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall
                     be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.
                &lt;/li&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 6.4.&lt;/var&gt;
                  In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been
                     validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
                     granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
                &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
          LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
          &lt;p&gt;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT,
             OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
             COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY
             INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
             LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR
             ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF
             THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR
             DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&amp;apos;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE
             LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
             INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO
             YOU.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
          U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
          &lt;p&gt;The Covered Software is a &amp;quot;commercial item,&amp;quot; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
             2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &amp;quot;commercial computer software&amp;quot; (as that term is
             defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and &amp;quot;commercial computer software
             documentation&amp;quot; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with
             48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government
             End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S.
             Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause
             or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;
          MISCELLANEOUS.
          &lt;p&gt;This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision
             of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
             extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the
             jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the
             extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction&amp;apos;s
             conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
             jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice
             contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs,
             including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&amp;apos; fees and expenses.
             The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
             Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
             contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree
             that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration
             regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
             distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;
          RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
          &lt;p&gt;As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages
             arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
             work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.
             Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)
        &lt;br /&gt;

The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of California
             (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be
             subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and
             the state courts of the State of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
             California.
      &lt;/p&gt;

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

3.6. Larger Works.
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

4.1. New Versions.
Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions.
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions.
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as “Participant”) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)
The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.
