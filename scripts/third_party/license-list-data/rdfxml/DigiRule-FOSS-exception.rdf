          Definitions.
          &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Derivative Work&amp;quot; means a derivative work, as defined
             under applicable copyright law, formed entirely from
             the Program and one or more FOSS Applications.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;FOSS Application&amp;quot; means a free and open source software
             application distributed subject to a license listed in
             the section below titled &amp;quot;FOSS License List.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;FOSS Notice&amp;quot; means a notice placed by DigiRule Solutions
             in a copy of the Client Libraries stating that such
             copy of the Client Libraries may be distributed under
             DigiRule Solutions&amp;apos;s or FOSS License Exception.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Independent Work&amp;quot; means portions of the Derivative Work
             that are not derived from the Program and can
             reasonably be considered independent and separate
             works.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Program&amp;quot; means a copy of DigiRule Solutions&amp;apos;s Client
             Libraries that contain a FOSS Notice.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
          A FOSS application developer (&amp;quot;you&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;your&amp;quot;) may
             distribute a Derivative Work provided that you and the
             Derivative Work meet all of the following
             conditions:
          
&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
              You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and all
                 portions (including modifications) of the Program
                 included in the Derivative Work (provided that this
                 condition does not apply to Independent Works);
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
              The Derivative Work does not include any work licensed
                 under the GPL other than the Program;
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
              You distribute Independent Works subject to a license
                 listed in the section below titled &amp;quot;FOSS License
                 List&amp;quot;;
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
              You distribute Independent Works in object code or
                 executable form with the complete corresponding
                 machine-readable source code on the same medium and
                 under the same FOSS license applying to the object
                 code or executable forms;
            &lt;/li&gt;
               
&lt;li&gt;
                  &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
              All works that are aggregated with the Program or the
                 Derivative Work on a medium or volume of storage are
                 not derivative works of the Program, Derivative Work
                 or FOSS Application, and must reasonably be considered
                 independent and separate works.
            &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
          DigiRule Solutions reserves all rights not expressly
             granted in these terms and conditions. If all of the
             above conditions are not met, then this FOSS License
             Exception does not apply to you or your Derivative
             Work.
