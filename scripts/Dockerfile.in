## The curl, jq and toybox containers build the corresponding binaries.

FROM alpine:3.16 AS curl

COPY third_party/curl /curl-src

COPY third_party/static-curl/build.sh /build.sh

RUN /build.sh


FROM alpine:3.16 AS jq

COPY third_party/jq /jq-src

COPY build-jq.sh /build-jq.sh

RUN /build-jq.sh


FROM alpine:3.16 AS toybox

COPY third_party/toybox /toybox-src

COPY build-toybox.sh /build-toybox.sh

RUN /build-toybox.sh


FROM alpine:3.16 AS inotify

COPY inotify.c /inotify.c

COPY build-inotify.sh /build-inotify.sh

RUN /build-inotify.sh


## The extras container extracts licenses and package data from Alpine packages.

FROM alpine:3.16 AS extras

COPY third_party/license-list-data /license-list-data-src

COPY alpine-extractor.sh /alpine-extractor.sh

# All dependencies used in build scripts above should be listed.
RUN /alpine-extractor.sh musl openssl-dev openssl-libs-static linux-headers


## The bash container fetches bash-static (to be used as bash) from Debian repo.

FROM debian:11.4 AS bash

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends --no-install-suggests bash-static
RUN dpkg -s bash-static > /tmp/status_bash-static


## The stuff container pulls all pieces together from containers above.
## We use this and copy all of them as a whole to reduce the number of layers in the final image.
## The base image is delibrately made separated so it can be shared with other images.
