1. License Grants; No Trademark License

   Subject to the terms of this License, I grant You:

   a) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license, to reproduce, Distribute, prepare derivative works
      of, publicly perform and publicly display My Work.

   b) A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable
      patent license under Licensed Patents to make, have made, use, sell,
      offer for sale, and import Covered Works.

   This License does not grant any rights in My name, trademarks, service
   marks, or logos.

2. Distribution: General Conditions

   You may Distribute Covered Works, provided that You (i) inform
   recipients how they can obtain a copy of this License; (ii) satisfy the
   applicable conditions of sections 3 through 6; and (iii) preserve all
   Legal Notices contained in My Work (to the extent they remain
   pertinent). "Legal Notices" means copyright notices, license notices,
   license texts, and author attributions, but does not include logos,
   other graphical images, trademarks or trademark legends.

3. Conditions for Distributing Derived Works; Outbound GPL Compatibility

   If You Distribute a Derived Work, You must license the entire Derived
   Work as a whole under this License, with prominent notice of such
   licensing. This condition may not be avoided through such means as
   separate Distribution of portions of the Derived Work.

   If the Derived Work includes material licensed under the GPL, You may
   instead license the Derived Work under the GPL.

4. Condition Against Further Restrictions; Inbound License Compatibility

   When Distributing a Covered Work, You may not impose further
   restrictions on the exercise of rights in the Covered Work granted under
   this License. This condition is not excused merely because such
   restrictions result from Your compliance with conditions or obligations
   extrinsic to this License (such as a court order or an agreement with a
   third party).

   However, You may Distribute a Covered Work incorporating material
   governed by a license that is both OSI-Approved and FSF-Free as of the
   release date of this License, provided that compliance with such
   other license would not conflict with any conditions stated in other
   sections of this License.

5. Conditions for Distributing Object Code

   You may Distribute an Object Code form of a Covered Work, provided that
   you accompany the Object Code with a URL through which the Corresponding
   Source is made available, at no charge, by some standard or customary
   means of providing network access to source code.

   If you Distribute the Object Code in a physical product or tangible
   storage medium ("Product"), the Corresponding Source must be available
   through such URL for two years from the date of Your most recent
   Distribution of the Object Code in the Product. However, if the Product
   itself contains or is accompanied by the Corresponding Source (made
   available in a customarily accessible manner), You need not also comply
   with the first paragraph of this section.

   Each direct and indirect recipient of the Covered Work from You is an
   intended third-party beneficiary of this License solely as to this
   section 5, with the right to enforce its terms.

6. Symmetrical Licensing Condition for Upstream Contributions

   If You Distribute a work to Me specifically for inclusion in or
   modification of a Covered Work (a "Patch"), and no explicit licensing
   terms apply to the Patch, You license the Patch under this License, to
   the extent of Your copyright in the Patch. This condition does not
   negate the other conditions of this License, if applicable to the Patch.

7. Nullification of Copyleft/Proprietary Dual Licensing

   If I offer to license, for a fee, a Covered Work under terms other than
   a license that is OSI-Approved or FSF-Free as of the release date of this
   License or a numbered version of copyleft-next released by the
   Copyleft-Next Project, then the license I grant You under section 1 is no
   longer subject to the conditions in sections 3 through 5.

8. Copyleft Sunset

   The conditions in sections 3 through 5 no longer apply once fifteen
   years have elapsed from the date of My first Distribution of My Work
   under this License.

9. Pass-Through

   When You Distribute a Covered Work, the recipient automatically receives
   a license to My Work from Me, subject to the terms of this License.

10. Termination

    Your license grants under section 1 are automatically terminated if You

    a) fail to comply with the conditions of this License, unless You cure
       such noncompliance within thirty days after becoming aware of it, or

    b) initiate a patent infringement litigation claim (excluding
       declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims, and cross-claims)
       alleging that any part of My Work directly or indirectly infringes
       any patent.

    Termination of Your license grants extends to all copies of Covered
    Works You subsequently obtain. Termination does not terminate the
    rights of those who have received copies or rights from You subject to
    this License.

    To the extent permission to make copies of a Covered Work is necessary
    merely for running it, such permission is not terminable.

11. Later License Versions

    The Copyleft-Next Project may release new versions of copyleft-next,
    designated by a distinguishing version number ("Later Versions").
    Unless I explicitly remove the option of Distributing Covered Works
    under Later Versions, You may Distribute Covered Works under any Later
    Version.

**     My Work is provided "as-is", without warranty. You bear the risk  **
**     of using it. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each      **
**     Distributor of My Work excludes the implied warranties of title,  **
**     merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and             **
**     non-infringement.                                                 **

**     To the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will any   **
**     Distributor of My Work be liable to You for any damages           **
**     whatsoever, whether direct, indirect, special, incidental, or     **
**     consequential damages, whether arising under contract, tort       **
**     (including negligence), or otherwise, even where the Distributor  **
**     knew or should have known about the possibility of such damages.  **

14. Severability

    The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this License
    does not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
    this License. Such provision is to be reformed to the minimum extent
    necessary to make it valid and enforceable.

    provided under (i); and (iii) a list clearly identifying all Separate
    Works (other than those provided in compliance with (ii)) that were
    specifically used in building and (if applicable) installing the
    Covered Work (for example, a specified proprietary compiler including
    its version number). Corresponding Source must be machine-readable.

    "Covered Work" means My Work or a Derived Work.

    "Derived Work" means a work of authorship that copies from, modifies,
    adapts, is based on, is a derivative work of, transforms, translates or
    contains all or part of My Work, such that copyright permission is
    required. The following are not Derived Works: (i) Mere Aggregation;

            &lt;p&gt;If You Distribute a Derived Work, You must license the entire Derived
            Work as a whole under this License, with prominent notice of such
            licensing. This condition may not be avoided through such means as

        &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 4.&lt;/var&gt;
            Condition Against Further Restrictions; Inbound License Compatibility

            &lt;p&gt;When Distributing a Covered Work, You may not impose further
            restrictions on the exercise of rights in the Covered Work granted under
            this License. This condition is not excused merely because such

            extrinsic to this License (such as a court order or an agreement with a
            third party).&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;However, You may Distribute a Covered Work incorporating material
            governed by a license that is both OSI-Approved and FSF-Free as of the
            release date of this License, provided that compliance with such
            other license would not conflict with any conditions stated in other
            sections of this License.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;

            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 5.&lt;/var&gt;
            Conditions for Distributing Object Code

            &lt;p&gt;You may Distribute an Object Code form of a Covered Work, provided that
            you accompany the Object Code with a URL through which the Corresponding
            Source is made available, at no charge, by some standard or customary
            means of providing network access to source code.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;If you Distribute the Object Code in a physical product or tangible
            storage medium (&amp;quot;Product&amp;quot;), the Corresponding Source must be available

            &lt;p&gt;Each direct and indirect recipient of the Covered Work from You is an
            intended third-party beneficiary of this License solely as to this

            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 6.&lt;/var&gt;
            Symmetrical Licensing Condition for Upstream Contributions

            &lt;p&gt;If You Distribute a work to Me specifically for inclusion in or
            modification of a Covered Work (a &amp;quot;Patch&amp;quot;), and no explicit licensing
            terms apply to the Patch, You license the Patch under this License, to
            the extent of Your copyright in the Patch. This condition does not
            negate the other conditions of this License, if applicable to the Patch.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 7.&lt;/var&gt;
            Nullification of Copyleft/Proprietary Dual Licensing

            &lt;p&gt;If I offer to license, for a fee, a Covered Work under terms other than
            a license that is OSI-Approved or FSF-Free as of the release date of this
            License or a numbered version of copyleft-next released by the
            Copyleft-Next Project, then the license I grant You under section 1 is no
            longer subject to the conditions in sections 3 through 5.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 8.&lt;/var&gt;
            Copyleft Sunset

            &lt;p&gt;The conditions in sections 3 through 5 no longer apply once fifteen
            years have elapsed from the date of My first Distribution of My Work
            under this License.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 9.&lt;/var&gt;
            Pass-Through

            &lt;p&gt;When You Distribute a Covered Work, the recipient automatically receives
            a license to My Work from Me, subject to the terms of this License.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 10.&lt;/var&gt;
            Termination
            &lt;p&gt;Your license grants under section 1 are automatically terminated if You&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
                    &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; a)&lt;/var&gt;
                    fail to comply with the conditions of this License, unless You cure
                    such noncompliance within thirty days after becoming aware of it, or
                &lt;/li&gt;
                
&lt;li&gt;
                    &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; b)&lt;/var&gt;
                    initiate a patent infringement litigation claim (excluding
                    declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims, and cross-claims)
                    alleging that any part of My Work directly or indirectly infringes
                    any patent.
                &lt;/li&gt;
            
&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Termination of Your license grants extends to all copies of Covered
            Works You subsequently obtain. Termination does not terminate the
            rights of those who have received copies or rights from You subject to
            this License.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;To the extent permission to make copies of a Covered Work is necessary
            merely for running it, such permission is not terminable.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 11.&lt;/var&gt;
            Later License Versions

            designated by a distinguishing version number (&amp;quot;Later Versions&amp;quot;).
            Unless I explicitly remove the option of Distributing Covered Works
            under Later Versions, You may Distribute Covered Works under any Later
            Version.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 12.&lt;/var&gt;
            No Warranty

            &lt;p&gt;My Work is provided &amp;quot;as-is&amp;quot;, without warranty. You bear the risk
            of using it. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each

            merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
            non-infringement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 13.&lt;/var&gt;
            Limitation of Liability

            &lt;p&gt;To the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will any
            Distributor of My Work be liable to You for any damages
            whatsoever, whether direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
            consequential damages, whether arising under contract, tort
            (including negligence), or otherwise, even where the Distributor
            knew or should have known about the possibility of such damages.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; License Grants; No Trademark License

   Subject to the terms of this License, I grant You:

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license, to reproduce, Distribute, prepare derivative works of, publicly perform and publicly display My Work.

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; A non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license under Licensed Patents to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, and import Covered Works.

   This License does not grant any rights in My name, trademarks, service marks, or logos.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Distribution: General Conditions

   You may Distribute Covered Works, provided that You (i) inform recipients how they can obtain a copy of this License; (ii) satisfy the applicable conditions of sections 3 through 6; and (iii) preserve all Legal Notices contained in My Work (to the extent they remain pertinent). "Legal Notices" means copyright notices, license notices, license texts, and author attributions, but does not include logos, other graphical images, trademarks or trademark legends.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Conditions for Distributing Derived Works; Outbound GPL Compatibility

   If You Distribute a Derived Work, You must license the entire Derived Work as a whole under this License, with prominent notice of such licensing. This condition may not be avoided through such means as separate Distribution of portions of the Derived Work.

   If the Derived Work includes material licensed under the GPL, You may instead license the Derived Work under the GPL.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Condition Against Further Restrictions; Inbound License Compatibility

   When Distributing a Covered Work, You may not impose further restrictions on the exercise of rights in the Covered Work granted under this License. This condition is not excused merely because such restrictions result from Your compliance with conditions or obligations extrinsic to this License (such as a court order or an agreement with a third party).

   However, You may Distribute a Covered Work incorporating material governed by a license that is both OSI-Approved and FSF-Free as of the release date of this License, provided that compliance with such other license would not conflict with any conditions stated in other sections of this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="5.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Conditions for Distributing Object Code

   You may Distribute an Object Code form of a Covered Work, provided that you accompany the Object Code with a URL through which the Corresponding Source is made available, at no charge, by some standard or customary means of providing network access to source code.

   If you Distribute the Object Code in a physical product or tangible storage medium ("Product"), the Corresponding Source must be available through such URL for two years from the date of Your most recent Distribution of the Object Code in the Product. However, if the Product itself contains or is accompanied by the Corresponding Source (made available in a customarily accessible manner), You need not also comply with the first paragraph of this section.

   Each direct and indirect recipient of the Covered Work from You is an intended third-party beneficiary of this License solely as to this section 5, with the right to enforce its terms.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="6.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Symmetrical Licensing Condition for Upstream Contributions

   If You Distribute a work to Me specifically for inclusion in or modification of a Covered Work (a "Patch"), and no explicit licensing terms apply to the Patch, You license the Patch under this License, to the extent of Your copyright in the Patch. This condition does not negate the other conditions of this License, if applicable to the Patch.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="7.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Nullification of Copyleft/Proprietary Dual Licensing

   If I offer to license, for a fee, a Covered Work under terms other than a license that is OSI-Approved or FSF-Free as of the release date of this License or a numbered version of copyleft-next released by the Copyleft-Next Project, then the license I grant You under section 1 is no longer subject to the conditions in sections 3 through 5.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="8.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Copyleft Sunset

   The conditions in sections 3 through 5 no longer apply once fifteen years have elapsed from the date of My first Distribution of My Work under this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="9.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Pass-Through

   When You Distribute a Covered Work, the recipient automatically receives a license to My Work from Me, subject to the terms of this License.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="10.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Termination

   Your license grants under section 1 are automatically terminated if You

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="a)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; fail to comply with the conditions of this License, unless You cure such noncompliance within thirty days after becoming aware of it, or

      &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="b)";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; initiate a patent infringement litigation claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counterclaims, and cross-claims) alleging that any part of My Work directly or indirectly infringes any patent.

   Termination of Your license grants extends to all copies of Covered Works You subsequently obtain. Termination does not terminate the rights of those who have received copies or rights from You subject to this License.

   To the extent permission to make copies of a Covered Work is necessary merely for running it, such permission is not terminable.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="11.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Later License Versions

   The Copyleft-Next Project may release new versions of copyleft-next, designated by a distinguishing version number ("Later Versions"). Unless I explicitly remove the option of Distributing Covered Works under Later Versions, You may Distribute Covered Works under any Later Version.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="12.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; No Warranty

   My Work is provided "as-is", without warranty. You bear the risk of using it. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Distributor of My Work excludes the implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="13.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Limitation of Liability

   To the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will any Distributor of My Work be liable to You for any damages whatsoever, whether direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages, whether arising under contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, even where the Distributor knew or should have known about the possibility of such damages.

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="14.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; Severability

   The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this License does not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of this License. Such provision is to be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable.
