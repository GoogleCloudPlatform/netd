      &lt;p&gt;The Qwt library and included programs are provided under the
         terms of the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (LGPL) with the
         following exceptions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style:none"&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 1.&lt;/var&gt;
          Widgets that are subclassed from Qwt widgets do not
             constitute a derivative work.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 2.&lt;/var&gt;
          Static linking of applications and widgets to the Qwt
             library does not constitute a derivative work and does
             not require the author to provide source code for the
             application or widget, use the shared Qwt libraries,
             or link their applications or widgets against a
             user-supplied version of Qwt. If you link the
             application or widget to a modified version of Qwt,
             then the changes to Qwt must be provided under the
             terms of the LGPL in sections 1, 2, and 4.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        
&lt;li&gt;
            &lt;var class="replacable-license-text"&gt; 3.&lt;/var&gt;
          You do not have to provide a copy of the Qwt license with
             programs that are linked to the Qwt library, nor do
             you have to identify the Qwt license in your program
             or documentation as required by section 6 of the
             LGPL.
        &lt;/li&gt;
      
&lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;However, programs must still identify their use of Qwt. The
         following example statement can be included in user
         documentation to satisfy this requirement: [program/widget] is
         based in part on the work of the Qwt project
         (http://qwt.sf.net).&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
