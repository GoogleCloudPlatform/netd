      <p> NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
         services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
         of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of &quot;derived work&quot;.
         Also note that the GPL below is copyrighted by the Free Software
         Foundation, but the instance of code that it refers to (the Linux
         kernel) is copyrighted by me and others who actually wrote it.</p>

      <p>Also note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as the kernel
      is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not
      v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.</p>
