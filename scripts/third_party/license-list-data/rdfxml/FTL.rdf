Introduction

The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages; some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the FreeType Project.

This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license. The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="o";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="o";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="o";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used the FreeType code. (`credits')

We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or without modifications, in commercial products. We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.

Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license. We thus encourage you to use the following text:

""" Portions of this software are copyright Â© &lt;year&gt; The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved. """

Please replace &lt;year&gt; with the value from the FreeType version you actually use.
